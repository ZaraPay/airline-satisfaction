Analysis of airline passenger satisfaction dataset using Python (EDA + Decision Tree + Random Forest + Logistic Regression)
✈️ Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

This project explores the Kaggle **Airline Passenger Satisfaction** dataset to find out what makes passengers satisfied or dissatisfied. I used **EDA** and three models: **Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression**.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle  
- ~25,000 passenger records  
- Target: Satisfaction (Satisfied vs Neutral/Dissatisfied)  

## 🔑 Key Findings
- **Boarding and WiFi** are the top drivers of satisfaction.  
- **Entertainment** also improves satisfaction, especially on long flights.  
- **Food, drink, and delays** lower satisfaction the most.  
- Economy/Eco Plus passengers are mostly dissatisfied (~80%).  

## 🤖 Model Results
- **Decision Tree**: Easy to interpret, boarding + WiFi are key factors.  
- **Random Forest**: Best accuracy (~87%), highlights boarding & WiFi.  
- **Logistic Regression**: Confirms boarding (+2.5x odds) and entertainment (+1.9x odds) as strong predictors.  

## 🚀 Recommendations
- Make **boarding smoother**  
- Improve **WiFi & entertainment**  
- Reduce **delays** and upgrade **food quality**  

## 🛠️ Tools
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
